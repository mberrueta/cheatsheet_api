  - 'Use some script:': "nmap --script default,safe\n\n"
  - Loads the script in the default category, the banner script, and all .nse files in the directory /home/user/customscripts.: "nmap
      --script default,banner,/home/user/customscripts\n\n"
  - Loads all scripts whose name starts with http-, such as http-auth and http-open-proxy.: "nmap
      --script 'http-*'\n\n"
  - Loads every script except for those in the intrusive category.: "nmap --script
      \"not intrusive\"\n\n"
  - Loads those scripts that are in both the default and safe categories.: "nmap --script
      \"default and safe\"\n\n"
  - Loads scripts in the default, safe, or intrusive categories, except for those whose names start with http-.: "nmap
      --script \"(default or safe or intrusive) and not http-*\"\n\n"
  - "-pT:443 => Scan only port 443 with TCP (T:)": "nmap -T5 --min-parallelism=50
      -n --script \"ssl-heartbleed\" -pT:443 127.0.0.1\n\n"
  - Show all informations (debug mode): "nmap -d ...\n\n"
  - Scan for available SSH connections (use root for additional output): "nmap -p
      22 192.168.0.0/24\n\n"
  - Port Status Information: |+
      - Open: This indicates that an application is listening for connections on this port.
      - Closed: This indicates that the probes were received but there is no application listening on this port.
      - Filtered: This indicates that the probes were not received and the state could not be established. It also indicates that the probes are being dropped by some kind of filtering.
      - Unfiltered: This indicates that the probes were received but a state could not be established.
      - Open/Filtered: This indicates that the port was filtered or open but Nmap couldn’t establish the state.
      - Closed/Filtered: This indicates that the port was filtered or closed but Nmap couldn’t establish the state.

  - Additional Scan Types: |2+

      nmap -sn: Probe only (host discovery, not port scan)
      nmap -sS: SYN Scan
      nmap -sT: TCP Connect Scan
      nmap -sU: UDP Scan
      nmap -sV: Version Scan
      nmap -O: Used for OS Detection/fingerprinting
      nmap --scanflags: Sets custom list of TCP using `URG ACK PSH RST SYN FIN` in any order

  - Nmap Scripting Engine Categories: |
      The most common Nmap scripting engine categories:
      - auth: Utilize credentials or bypass authentication on target hosts.
      - broadcast: Discover hosts not included on command line by broadcasting on local network.
      - brute: Attempt to guess passwords on target systems, for a variety of protocols, including http, SNMP, IAX, MySQL, VNC, etc.
      - default: Scripts run automatically when -sC or -A are used.
      - discovery: Try to learn more information about target hosts through public sources of information, SNMP, directory services, and more.
      - dos: May cause denial of service conditions in target hosts.
      - exploit: Attempt to exploit target systems.
      - external: Interact with third-party systems not included in target list.
      - fuzzer: Send unexpected input in network protocol fields.
      - intrusive: May crash target, consume excessive resources, or otherwise impact target machines in a malicious fashion.
      - malware: Look for signs of malware infection on the target hosts.
      - safe: Designed not to impact target in a negative fashion.
      - version: Measure the version of software or protocols on the target hosts.
      - vul: Measure whether target systems have a known vulnerability.
